# Walmart-bot
1 . await page.waitForSelector("input[name='Email Address']");  Should I take the name of the attribute? or the type? Idk

2. I put the add to cart and continue to checkout button clicks in the same function. Should I seperate them?

3. I forgot to make a new node_module but I forgot soo... this repo has everything expected for my node modules.

4. I saw in the Walmart.js bot that there was chrome-location. I put the code in mine but I kept getting compile errors so I took it out. What is it for? Do i need it?


We should do two times a week frrr cause I have questions.
