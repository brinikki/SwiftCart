# Walmart-bot
await page.waitForSelector("input[name='Email Address']");  Should I take the name of the attribute? or the type? Idk

I put the add to cart and continue to checkout button clicks in the same function. Should I seperate them?

I forgot to make a new node_module but I forgot soo... this repo has everything expected for my node modules.


We should do two times a week frrr cause I have questions.
